# Aerospace_Labs
This repository is an ongoing compilation of the lab work I have done as part of fulfillment of my Aerospace degree. Some of the code for these labs was written by other group members, and if this is the case, the authorship info in each MATLAB function will indicate this.

## Running Code
Running the code for an individual lab simply requires the MATLAB interpreter, and for one to download at least the folder for the lab in question. 
* DO NOT MODIFY the directory structure, as typically I wrote the lab code such that data and figure generated were separated from code directories. 
* Each Code Folder will typically have a main script that will run the entire routine. This should be clear by naming conventions amongst the constituent code filenames.
