function [ L, t ] = tangent_length( I, R, m, w_0 )
%ANALYZE Calculates required length, L, and deployment time, t of a
%satellite despinner for a tangential release.

% Inputs: -Total Moment of inertia of satellite (w/o despinners), I(kg*m^2).
%         -Outer radius of same satellite, R (m).
%         -Mass of each despinner, m (kg).
%         -Initial angular velocity before despinners released, w (rpm)
% Outputs: -Required string length, L (m), to stop satellite
%          -time required to stop, t (s)
